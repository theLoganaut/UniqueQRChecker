Handles checking the Unique ID each QR is assigned. To keep fetch calls at a minimum, this saves the QR id locally, and searching through through local data to find it instead of calling the server.

No personal information or identifiers are saved so there's no need to ask for consent as of right now.

This is likely only to be used by CentexQRs, but if you would like to know how its used, read the bottom comments in the file.
